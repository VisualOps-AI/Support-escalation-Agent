    "question": "The app keeps crashing when I try to upload files",
    "answer": "File upload crashes are usually caused by: 1) Files exceeding the 100MB limit - try compressing or splitting large files. 2) Unsupported file formats - we support PDF, DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX, PNG, JPG, and GIF. 3) Browser cache issues - try clearing your cache or using incognito mode. 4) Browser extensions - disable ad blockers temporarily. If the issue persists, try a different browser.",
